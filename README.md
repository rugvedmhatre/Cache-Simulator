# Cache-Simulator
Implementing a two-level (L1 and L2) cache system with configurable parameters such as block size and associativity. Takes memory address trace files as input for precise cache behavior emulation and performance analysis. An invaluable tool for exploring cache configurations and optimizing memory hierarchies for enhanced system performance.
